propparser Instructions

-------------------------------------------

1) Make sure you have Bison and Flex installed.

If you encounter problems, make sure they are installed to a path without spaces, e.g. C:\GnuWin32, and that the bin directory is added to the system path.

2) Build propparser using CMake, setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the propparser directory itself.

***

Notes:

(a)

It may be necessary to add the modules FindBISON.cmake and FindFLEX.cmake to CMake's module path.

On Windows (using CMake 2.6 as an example), this is located at:

<install location>\share\cmake-2.6\Modules\

On Linux, it tends to be at:

/usr/share/cmake-2.6/Modules

(b)

On Windows, it may be necessary to add the GnuWin32\bin directory to the system path so that the m4 executable can be found.
