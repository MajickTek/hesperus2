propparser Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 24/11/09
-------------------------------------------

1) Make sure you have Bison and Flex installed.

2) Build propparser using CMake, setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the propparser directory itself.

***

Note:

It may be necessary to add the modules FindBISON.cmake and FindFLEX.cmake to CMake's module path.

On Windows (using CMake 2.6 as an example), this is located at:

<install location>\share\cmake-2.6\Modules\

On Linux, it tends to be at:

/usr/share/cmake-2.6/Modules
