# Usage
In the center of the screen there are 4 viewports. Clockwise they are:

* the 3D viewport

* the X, -Y viewport

* the X, -Z viewport

* the Y, -Z viewport.

On the left of these are the brush tools. They are self explanatory. They are Select, Block, Cylinder, Cone, UV Sphere, Landscape, and Light.

Use the Select tool to select a brush (with left click) and change the select mode with right click. Drag the handles (square, circle, or diamond) to change object properties.

To create a brush, select a shape and drag within viewports 2, 3, and 4 (not the 3d viewport).

On the top of the viewports is the toolbar. The File and Edit menus are standard. The View menu allows you to change visual properties of the editor.

The Map menu allows you to view the map information as well as compile the map if you have the required tools.

The Brush menu allows you to do standard 3d brush manipulation as well as CSG modeling.

Under Brush | CSG you get boolean modifiers as well as the ability to hollow out and split brushes, These are useful for quickly creating rooms.

Under Brush | Landscape you get two options: increase and decrease the landscape resolution.

The Texture menu allows you to load in an external texture and edit a brush's current texture (including UV offsets).

The Options menu gives you different settings for the 3D view.
