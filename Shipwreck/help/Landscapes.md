Landscapes
===

To use the landscape feature you first create a Landscape brush using the menu on the right.

Then you use the select tool to select your brush and use Brush | Landscape | Increase Resolution to make it higher-res.

Select it again if necessary and right click until you see blue circles appear. Dragging these circles modifies the hight of your terrain.

The more resolution the terrain has, the higher (and bigger) you can make it. However, keep in mind that very high resolutions can cause lag in-game.
