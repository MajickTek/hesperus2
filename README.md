# hesperus2
A fully-working 3D map editor (in Java) and level compilation toolchain (in C++), and a part-finished 3D game engine (in C++). Early development was done in the hesperus project and ported to CMake to form hesperus2.

# TODO

Make the build process easier; make Shipwreck's build.sh work properly.
