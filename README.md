# hesperus2
A fully-working 3D map editor (in Java) and level compilation toolchain (in C++), and a part-finished 3D game engine (in C++). Early development was done in the hesperus project and ported to CMake to form hesperus2.

# TODO

Make the build process easier; make Shipwreck's build.sh work properly.

Shipwreck is actually updated in the update-shipwreck branch; although the engine is completely different in terms of libs etc.

Update dependencies.

Make CMake compilation up-to-date.

Push new updates to main repo as a pull request?
